> **Title:** Trust and Perception of an AI System

> **Abstract:** The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution is upon us, with the promise of advances such as driverless cars, smart buildings, automated health diagnostics and improved security monitoring. Many current efforts are aimed to measure system trustworthiness through measurements of Accuracy, Reliability, and Explainability, among other system characteristics. While these characteristics are necessary, determining that the AI system is trustworthy because it meets its system requirements won’t ensure widespread adoption of AI.  It is the user, the human affected by, the AI who ultimately places their trust in the system.

> **Biography:** Brian Stanton (brian.stanton@nist.gov) is a Cognitive Scientist in the Visualization and Usability Group at the National Institute of Standards and Technology where, for the last six years he has been the leading researcher on the Artificial Intelligence User Trust project. He has worked on biometric projects for the Department of Homeland Security, Federal Bureau of Investigation's Hostage Rescue Team, and with Latent Fingerprint examiners. Previously he worked in private industry designing user interfaces for air traffic control systems and B2B web applications.

> **Title:** Trusting the outcomes of AI models: Experiences from Applications of AI in IoT Solutions

> **Abstract:** Although the applications of AI and Machine Learning holds the promise of significant improvements in creating IoT solutions, a careless application of AI may do more harm than good.  Application of AI needs to be done with a careful understanding of the assumptions underlying the data for training, and exploring the differences in the training environment and the operational environment. In the course of deploying AI based solutions to tasks such as detection of IoT devices in the network, or in the use of acoustics for various IoT solutions, we came across several challenges in making AI based solutions work in a reliable and trustworthy manner.  On those experiences, we have drawn up a set of best practices for use of AI technologies in IoT solutions to develop resilient and trustworthy solutions. We believe these best practices should generalize to applications of AI in general, and would provide an overview of the same in the talk.

> **Biography:** Dinesh C. Verma is a Fellow of UK Royal Academy of Engineering, an IEEE Fellow and an IBM Fellow. Currently, he is working as the Chief Scientist of the Research Consulting Program with a focus on US Public Sector. He has authored 11 books, 150+ technical papers and 185+ U.S. patents. He has chaired/vice-chaired IEEE technical committee on computer communications, as well as IEEE Internet technical committee. He has served on various program committees and editorial boards. He is a member of the IBM Academy of Technology, an IBM Master Inventor, and won several IBM internal technical awards. He has contributed to several IBM products and service offerings including significant contributions to server networking stack, network management products, edge computing and cellular network analytics. He has led several multi-national multi-organizational research programs. More details about Dinesh can be seen at [http://ibm.biz/dineshverma](http://ibm.biz/dineshverma)

> **Title:** Challenges and Opportunities in Trustworthy AI for Health and Wellness

> **Abstract:** AI is regarded as the most promising tool to improve the quality of health care while reducing cost. It can be employed in many stages of care, including AI-assisted diagnosis from radiological images, AI-enabled robotic surgeries, AI-enabled wearables to remotely detect early signs of disease onset or deterioration, managing medication compliance and administration via AI-enabled conversational robots, assisting with post-treatment recovery via AI-powered virtual therapists, and surgical training.

> As the cost of failure in AI in many of these cases can result in health deterioration and threaten life, several fundamental scientific and engineering challenges need to be successfully resolved so that AI-enabled systems can gain and retain trust from various stakeholders. The incorporation of AI in healthcare decision-making, devices, and procedures also presents legal, regulatory, and ethical issues that are at their core about trust and trustworthiness.

> **Biography:** Santosh Kumar is the Lillian & Morrie Moss Professor of Computer Science at University of Memphis and Director of NIH-funded mHealth research centers called MD2K and mDOT. His research develops wearable AI to enable the development, optimization, and privacy-aware deployment of sensor-triggered health interventions. Open-source software developed by his team has been used to conduct scientific studies nationwide, producing hundreds of terabytes of wearable sensor data. His team has used these data to develop AI models for detecting stress, smoking, craving, cocaine use, brushing, and flossing from wearables.

> **Title:** Fair and efficient valuation in data marketplaces

> **Abstract:** Data marketplaces are promising for harvesting data from many data owners to support many second-uses. Data assemblage, that is, integrating data from existing data sets to derive new data sets, is an important task in data marketplaces. However, fair and efficient valuation in data marketplaces, particularly in data assemblage tasks, is challenging. There are many data owners and many different ways to assemble data. To achieve fair and efficient valuation in data assemblage tasks in data marketplaces, we are exploring a principled approach -- the decomposability of utility in data assemblage tasks. For example, taking the advantage of sparsity in data assemblage, we show that assessing exact Shapley value of data in assemblage tasks of integrating millions of records from tens of owners is highly practical. In this talk, I will share some of the latest progress and insights on this exciting direction.

> **Biography:** Jian Pei is Professor at Duke University and Simon Fraser University (on leave). His research focuses on data science, data mining, database systems, information retrieval and applied machine learning. His expertise is on developing effective and efficient data analysis techniques for novel data intensive applications, and transferring to products and business practice. He is recognized as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada (Canada's national academy), the Canadian Academy of Engineering, ACM and IEEE. He received several prestigious awards, including the 2017 ACM SIGKDD Innovation Award, the 2015 ACM SIGKDD Service Award, and the 2014 IEEE ICDM Research Contributions Award. He was a past chair of ACM SIGKDD and a past EIC of IEEE TKDE.
