> **Title:** AI Risk Management

> **Abstract:** AI systems sometimes do not operate as intended because they are making inferences from patterns observed in data rather than a true understanding of what causes those patterns. Ensuring that these inferences are helpful and not harmful in particular use cases – especially when inferences are rapidly scaled and amplified – is fundamental to trustworthy AI. While answers to the question of what makes an AI technology trustworthy differ, there are certain key characteristics which support trustworthiness, including accuracy, explainability and interpretability, privacy, reliability, robustness, safety, security (resilience) and mitigation of harmful bias. There also are key guiding principles to take into account such as accountability, fairness, and equity. Cultivating trust and communication about how to understand and manage the risks of AI systems will help create opportunities for innovation and realize the full potential of this technology.<br /> 
This presentation overviews NIST’s effort in developing a framework to better manage risks to individuals, organizations, and society associated with AI. The NIST Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework (AI RMF or Framework) is intended for voluntary use and to improve the ability to incorporate trustworthiness considerations into the design, development, use, and evaluation of AI products, services, and systems.

> **Biography:** Elham Tabassi is the Chief of Staff in the Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). She leads NIST Trustworthy and Responsible AI program that aims to cultivate trust in the design, development, and use of AI technologies by improving measurement science, standards, and related tools in ways that enhance economic security and improve quality of life. She has been working on various machine learning and computer vision research projects with applications in biometrics evaluation and standards since she joined NIST in 1999.

> **Title:** Trust and Perception of an AI System

> **Abstract:** The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution is upon us, with the promise of advances such as driverless cars, smart buildings, automated health diagnostics and improved security monitoring. Many current efforts are aimed to measure system trustworthiness through measurements of Accuracy, Reliability, and Explainability, among other system characteristics. While these characteristics are necessary, determining that the AI system is trustworthy because it meets its system requirements won’t ensure widespread adoption of AI.  It is the user, the human affected by, the AI who ultimately places their trust in the system.

> **Biography:** Brian Stanton (brian.stanton@nist.gov) is a Cognitive Scientist in the Visualization and Usability Group at the National Institute of Standards and Technology where, for the last six years he has been the leading researcher on the Artificial Intelligence User Trust project.

> **Title:** Trusting the outcomes of AI models: Experiences from Applications of AI in IoT Solutions

> **Abstract:** Although the applications of AI and Machine Learning holds the promise of significant improvements in creating IoT solutions, a careless application of AI may do more harm than good.  Application of AI needs to be done with a careful understanding of the assumptions underlying the data for training, and exploring the differences in the training environment and the operational environment. In the course of deploying AI based solutions to tasks such as detection of IoT devices in the network, or in the use of acoustics for various IoT solutions, we came across several challenges in making AI based solutions work in a reliable and trustworthy manner.  On those experiences, we have drawn up a set of best practices for use of AI technologies in IoT solutions to develop resilient and trustworthy solutions. We believe these best practices should generalize to applications of AI in general, and would provide an overview of the same in the talk.

> **Title:** Challenges and Opportunities in Trustworthy AI for Health and Wellness

> **Abstract:** AI is regarded as the most promising tool to improve the quality of health care while reducing cost. It can be employed in many stages of care, including AI-assisted diagnosis from radiological images, AI-enabled robotic surgeries, AI-enabled wearables to remotely detect early signs of disease onset or deterioration, managing medication compliance and administration via AI-enabled conversational robots, assisting with post-treatment recovery via AI-powered virtual therapists, and surgical training.

> As the cost of failure in AI in many of these cases can result in health deterioration and threaten life, several fundamental scientific and engineering challenges need to be successfully resolved so that AI-enabled systems can gain and retain trust from various stakeholders. The incorporation of AI in healthcare decision-making, devices, and procedures also presents legal, regulatory, and ethical issues that are at their core about trust and trustworthiness.

> **Biography:** Santosh Kumar is the Lillian & Morrie Moss Professor of Computer Science at University of Memphis and Director of NIH-funded mHealth research centers called MD2K and mDOT. His research develops wearable AI to enable the development, optimization, and privacy-aware deployment of sensor-triggered health interventions.

> **Title:** From trustworthy AI to appropriate trust: lessons from human-centered explainable AI

> **Abstract:** Explainability is often considered one of the pillars of trustworthy AI. The past few years have seen a surge of interest in algorithms, methods, and toolkits to make AI explainable, with one goal, among others, being engendering trust in users. However, empirical studies that examine people’s interactions with AI explanations have shown mixed results of their effectiveness and warned that even technical sound explanations can potentially result in harmful over-trust and over-reliance. In this talk, I will discuss lessons from research on human-centered explainable AI, and argue that technology creators’ responsibility is not limited to AI trustworthiness, but also responsibly communicating the trustworthiness to ensure appropriate and equitable user trust. I will also draw on social science and human-computer interaction (HCI) literature on trust in technologies to suggest paths forward for responsibly building trust in AI.

> **Biography:** Q. Vera Liao is a Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research Montréal, where she is part of the FATE (Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Ethics of AI) group. Her current research interests are in human-AI interaction, explainable AI, and responsible AI. Prior to joining MSR, she worked at IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, and studied at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Tsinghua University. Her research received multiple paper awards at ACM CHI and IUI. She currently serves as the Co-Editor-in-Chief for Springer HCI Book Series, in the Editors team for ACM CSCW conferences, and on the Editorial Board of ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TiiS).
