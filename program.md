>_Title:_ Trusting the outcomes of AI models: Experiences from Applications of AI in IoT Solutions”

>_Abstract:_ Although the applications of AI and Machine Learning holds the promise of significant improvements in creating IoT solutions, a careless application of AI may do more harm than good.  Application of AI needs to be done with a careful understanding of the assumptions underlying the data for training, and exploring the differences in the training environment and the operational environment. In the course of deploying AI based solutions to tasks such as detection of IoT devices in the network, or in the use of acoustics for various IoT solutions, we came across several challenges in making AI based solutions work in a reliable and trustworthy manner.  On those experiences, we have drawn up a set of best practices for use of AI technologies in IoT solutions to develop resilient and trustworthy solutions. We believe these best practices should generalize to applications of AI in general, and would provide an overview of the same in the talk.
