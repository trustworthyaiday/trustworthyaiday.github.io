# About

Trustworthiness of AI is key to accelerating the acceptance and adoption of AI technologies, realizing all of its potential benefits to society. Recognizing its importance, KDD 2022 is organizing a special day event to present a holistic view of AI trustworthiness. 

KDD Trustworthy AI Day 2022 will take place on **August 15, 2022, 8am-5pm PST**. On behalf of the Trustworthy AI Day and KDD 2022 organizing committee, we welcome you all to attend this event!

# To attend the event, please register for [KDD conference](https://www.kdd.org/kdd2022/registration.html) and join us via [this link](https://trustworthyaiday.github.io/).


<!-- #Call

We plan to solicit short paper submissions for “deep learning critique” from the community, which aims to better understand and to improve all stages of the research process in deep learning. Accepted papers will be given a 15-min slot for contributed talk on the DL day. We invite you to refer to an earlier effort to register trends and debates, analyze bad practices and inventorize open problems at “Critiquing and Correcting Trends in Machine Learning 2018” Workshop: https://ml-critique-correct.github.io/.
